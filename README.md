## JWT
 JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) for securely transmitting information between parties as JSON object.
 The purpose of using JWT is not to hide data but to ensure the authenticity of the data.   
 JWT is a token based stateless authentication mechanism. Since it is a client-side based stateless session, server doesnâ€™t have to completely rely on a datastore(database) to save session information. 
 Structure of JWT
    - A JSON Web Token consists of 3 parts separated by a period.
    - header.payload.signature
    - Header 
       JWT header consists of token type and algorithm used for signing and encoding. Algorithms can be HMAC, SHA256, RSA, HS256 or     RS256.
